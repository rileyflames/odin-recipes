    <img src="../images/rhubarb-cake.jpg">

    <p>This rhubarb custard cake is a deliciously different cake that's very popular in Germany. The base of the cake is rich and buttery and is topped with chopped rhubarb and a decadent baked almond custard. Perfect with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</p>

    <h2>Rhubarb Filling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups peeled and chopped rhubarb</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cake base</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Almond Custard</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup crème fraîche</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the rhubarb filling: Combine rhubarb and sugar in a large bowl. Mix to combine and set aside to allow the rhubarb to release some juice, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>For the cake: Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add flour, wine, baking powder, and egg; mix together to form a dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform cake pan.</li>
        <li>Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a circle slightly larger than the diameter of the cake pan. Transfer to the prepared cake pan, letting the dough come up the sides by about 1 inch.</li>
        <li>Drain rhubarb and evenly scatter over the dough; bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the custard filling: beat almond flour, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons crème fraîche, sugar, eggs, vanilla sugar, and cinnamon together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Remove cake from oven after 45 minutes; top with almond custard mixture and use a spatula to spread it evenly to the sides of the pan. Return cake to the oven and bake until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan before slicing.</li>
